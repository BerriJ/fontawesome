# The fontawesome package

The **fontawesome** package makes it very easy to insert **FontAwesome** icons within R Markdown documents and Shiny apps.

## Example

The `fa()` function can be used to insert an FA icon. For example, we can get the *r-project* icon in `steelblue`:

```{r example}
fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")
```

As can be seen, what we really get from the function is a character object providing inline SVG for the icon (i.e., SVG within `<svg>...</svg>`). This can be directly used within R Markdown with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
{text} `r fa(...)` {text}
```

Here is an example R Markdown document that includes FontAwesome icons:

````

title: "FontAwesome in R Markdown"

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE} `r ''`
library(fontawesome)
```

# Just a few tests with `r "\u0060r fa(\"font-awesome-logo-full\", fill = \"forestgreen\")\u0060"`

It works well in headings...

# `r "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"` H1 Heading

## `r "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"` H2 Heading

### `r "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"` H3 Heading

#### `r "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"` H4 Heading

##### `r "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"` H5 Heading

...and works equally well within inline text: `r  "\u0060r fa(\"r-project\", fill = \"steelblue\")\u0060"`.

This will appear, when knit, as:
