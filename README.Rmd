# The fontawesome package

The **fontawesome** package makes it very easy to insert **FontAwesome** icons within R Markdown documents and Shiny apps.

## Example

The `fa()` function can be used to insert an FA icon. For example, we can get the *r-project* icon in `steelblue`:

```{r example}
fa(name = "r-project", fill = "steelblue")
```

As can be seen, what we really get from the function is a character object providing inline SVG for the icon (i.e., SVG within `<svg>...</svg>`). This can be directly used within R Markdown with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
{text} `r fa(...)` {text}
```
